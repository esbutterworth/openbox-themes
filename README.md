# openbox-themes
Themes I've written or modified for Openbox.

Currently, there's only one theme here: "Triste Dracula," modified from the Triste themes by addy-dclxvi over at <https://github.com/addy-dclxvi/openbox-theme-collections>, using the Dracula color scheme at <https://github.com/dracula/dracula-theme>.

I use it with the [Ant-Dracula](https://github.com/EliverLara/Ant-Dracula) GTK theme.
