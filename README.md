# openbox-themes
Themes I've modified for Openbox.

The first theme here is an openbox theme called "Triste Dracula," modified from the Triste themes by addy-dclxvi over at <https://github.com/addy-dclxvi/openbox-theme-collections>, using the Dracula color scheme at <https://github.com/dracula/dracula-theme>. It also includes an xfce4-notifyd theme to match. 

I use these with the [Ant-Dracula](https://github.com/EliverLara/Ant-Dracula) GTK theme.
